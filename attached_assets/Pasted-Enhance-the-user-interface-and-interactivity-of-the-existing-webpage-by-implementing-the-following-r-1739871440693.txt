Enhance the user interface and interactivity of the existing webpage by implementing the following refinements with precision, consistency, and a seamless user experience:

Integrate Glow Effects for Buttons

Apply a subtle yet visually striking neon glow effect to all buttons, ensuring consistency with the website’s dark theme and neon green (#00FF00) accent color scheme.
The glow intensity should dynamically adjust based on hover state and user interaction, creating an immersive effect.
Implement smooth transition animations to prevent abrupt visual changes.
Incorporate Fluid Section Transitions

Introduce scroll-triggered animations to create a natural, fluid transition between sections, enhancing the navigational flow and user engagement.
Use fade-ins, slide-ins, or parallax effects that align with the modern, high-tech aesthetic of the webpage.
Ensure animations are performance-optimized to maintain a smooth experience across all devices, including mobile.
Enhance the Contact Section with an Engaging Design

Elevate the visual appeal of the contact section by integrating interactive design elements such as glowing input fields, subtle hover effects, and animated form validation.
Implement aesthetic enhancements like border animations, soft drop shadows, or pulsating effects to make the form feel dynamic while maintaining a clean, professional look.
Ensure error messages and validation feedback are visually distinct yet non-intrusive, providing an intuitive user experience.
Ensure Full Navigation Bar Functionality

Verify and implement fully functional navigation links that smoothly scroll to their respective sections using optimized JavaScript or CSS-based scrolling techniques.
Highlight active navigation items with a subtle animated underline or color change effect, improving visual hierarchy and user orientation.
Ensure the navigation bar remains sticky on scroll while maintaining adaptive responsiveness for mobile devices, incorporating a hamburger menu animation where applicable.Enhance the user interface and interactivity of the existing webpage by implementing the following refinements with precision, consistency, and a seamless user experience:
