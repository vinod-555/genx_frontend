Prompt for Website Generation

Create a modern, single-page website for GenX Reality, an AR/VR technology company focused on accessibility and affordability. The design should be sleek, highly interactive, and feature a dark theme with neon green (#00FF00) accents. The site must be fully responsive with smooth animations and a polished user experience. The codebase should be clean, modular, and semantic, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with clear placeholders for easy content customization.
